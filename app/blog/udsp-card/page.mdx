# uDSP-Card: XCORE.AI Development Board for Portable Applications

This post introduces the uDSP-Card, a compact development board built on the XMOS XCORE.AI platform and tailored for portable and wearable applications. Despite its small footprint, it offers rich I/O and high-performance DSP capabilities at low power, making it ideal for audio, sensing, and real-time embedded tasks.

## Overview

The **uDSP-Card** was originally designed for a battery-powered, head-mounted system that interfaced with MEMS microphones, an 8-channel DAC, an ESP32-based wireless module, and a custom battery module. While tailored for this specific application, the board’s flexible I/O and modular architecture making it ideal for audio, sensing, and real-time embedded tasks.
